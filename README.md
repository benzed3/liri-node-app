# liri-node-app

### The purpose of this app is to pull information about concerts, songs, and movies on node, using OMDB and Spotify, and display that information on the console.
### Certain entries will pull up specific information, such as 'concert-this' for concerts, 'spotify-this-song' for songs, and 'movie-this for movies. Doing so will pull up certain information on the thing searched for, such as venue, date, artist, etc.
### The information will be logged into the console through node detailing the information.
